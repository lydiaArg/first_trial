## Sofia Lydia Ntella

I'm a PhD student in the [Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lai/), in EPFL, Switzerland. 

I received a joint BSc and MSc degree from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ee.auth.gr/en) of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2017. After graduating, I worked as an embedded software engineer in [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en/company/about-asml/asml-at-a-glance), a dutch company, located in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which is at the present time, the world's leading lithography machines producer. In July 2019, I joined LAI, EPFL, where I am currently working on the development of a smart wearable footwear solution, with the aim to prevent ulcerations in diabetic patients.
